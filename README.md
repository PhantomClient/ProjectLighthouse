# Project Lighthouse

Project Lighthouse is a clean-room, open-source custom server for LittleBigPlanet. This is a project conducted by
the [LBP Union Ministry of Technology Research and Development team](https://www.lbpunion.com/technology).

This is a fork for [Project Lighthouse](https://github.com/LBPUnion/ProjectLighthouse) mainly dedicated towards the building section that they didn't create a tutorial yet as of March 4th, 2022.

## Building

Requirements:
- [.NET SDK (6.0)](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0)
- [ASP.NET Core Runtime Hosting Bundle (6.0)](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0)
- Internet Information Services / IIS
- [Apache, MySQL, phpMyAdmin](http://appserv.org)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
- [IIS Url Rewrite](https://www.iis.net/downloads/microsoft/url-rewrite)
- A basic understanding of Port Forwarding

Downloading the files should be pretty self explanatory however setting up IIS will be required after you build [Project Lighthouse](https://github.com/LBPUnion/ProjectLighthouse). Also when doing the appserv setup make the root password whatever you want as long as you can remember it. I recommend writing it down somewhere whether it's in a txt file / document. I'll be using the root password "l1ghthous3".

After setting up appserv you can start it if you want. If you start it up from the appserv installation then you won't have to worry about manually running it. However keep in mind that if you close it out of task manager or restart your pc you will have to start it up manually.
